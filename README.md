This is a dumping ground for notes I take as I play with technologies.

This may be useful to some people, at some time, for something... but I really use it as a public scratch pad so it is likely things will go out of date quite quickly.

One of the things I use these demo's for is that when I'm learning something I find it useful to run through common scenarios regularly. I often use these scripts when something is new to me to run 'Katas'.
